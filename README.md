The purpose of this study is to obtain a reliable model which can predict efficiency and identify the process variables that should be optimised to improve the overall process efficiency. Initial proof of concept on a singular process unit for which variable relationships are well understood is the need. Here the process unit applicable would be D3 Distillation uni
